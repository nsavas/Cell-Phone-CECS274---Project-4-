# CECS274 Project 4

OOP Project 4:

This project allows users to make/receive calls and create contact objects with a name, phone number, email, and notes which are then
added to a phonebook.

These contacts can be removed, edited, and displayed. The phonebook class keeps track of the contacts within an
array list of contact objects. 

Contacts can then be added to a favorites/speed dial list. Favorites can contain a maximum of 5 contacts.

Contacts within the favorites list can be removed, rearranged, and displayed. They can also have an image set
for them that creates a popup window with their information and picture when displayed.

Calls can also be made and received. User can make a call to a contact by name or phone number, by speed dial, and with
a phone number not associated with a contact.

Each call that is made/received is stored in a call log that can be displayed. Calls made to the same phone number creates
only one instance of the log with the amount of calls and name/phone number.

Example:
```
(3) John
```

The information for each instance can be accessed as well by typing in the name or phone number.
